          Overriding Specificity !
        </h1>
        <p class="paragraph" id="main-section-para">
          In this lesson we are learning how to override the specificity in a
          way that it can never get overridden again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note : This heading is styled as Red color with cyan background in the
          CSS file but the style will not get updated here despite using ID
          selector, along with chaining it to the class selector

        <h2>We can override it in two ways :</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline Element : They have specificity value of 1000</li>
          <li>!Important Tag : </li>

            <li>
              This is the first CSS that was applied and this was overridden by
              the second one.
              <strong>h1 { background-color: cyan; color: red;}</strong>
            </li>

              This is the second CSS that was applied and this was overridden by
              the third one.
              <strong>.main-heading {
    background-color: yellow;
    color: rgb(241, 89, 152);

/* this is class selector and this overrides the element selector */</strong>

            <li>
              This is the third CSS that was applied and this was overridden by
              the fourth one.
              <strong>#main-headblock {
    background-color: darksalmon;

            <li>
              This is the fourth CSS that was applied and this was overridden by
              the fifth one.
              <strong>#main-headblock.main-heading {
    background-color: green;
    color: red;
}

/* this is chaining selectors to increase the specificity and this will be applied */</strong>

            <li>
              This is the fifth CSS that was applied and this was overridden by
              the second one.
              <strong>html body main section .main-heading#main-headblock {
    background-color: red;
    color: green;
}

/* and this is another way to increase the specificity */</strong>
            </li>

          <p>Even this can be overridden by inline styling or by !important keyword.</p>
